      <p className="mb-4">
        CrowdFund Connect is a simple, frontend-only crowdfunding platform built
        with React. Our mission is to connect donors with causes that matter —
        using a clean, coin-based donation system.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In this virtual platform, users can browse causes, add coins, and donate
        to events with just a few clicks. It’s designed for demo and educational
        purposes.
